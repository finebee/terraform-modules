# Pipeline Management Guide

## Pipeline Health Monitoring
- Monitor build times and success rates
- Track resource usage during builds
- Identify bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
- Analyze test coverage and failures

## Common Issues & Solutions
1. Long Build Times
   - Parallel execution opportunities
   - Cache optimization
   - Resource allocation adjustment
   - Test optimization

2. Failed Builds
   - Dependencies issues
   - Environment problems
   - Resource constraints
   - Configuration errors

3. Security Issues
   - Dependency vulnerabilities
   - Access control problems
   - Secret management
   - Code scanning alerts

## Best Practices
1. Always use version pinning
2. Implement proper caching
3. Regular dependency updates
4. Comprehensive test coverage
5. Security scanning integration
