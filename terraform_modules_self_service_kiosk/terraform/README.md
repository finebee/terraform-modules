# üöÄ Terraform Modules Self-Service Kiosk

The **Terraform Modules Self-Service Kiosk** is your intelligent assistant within the Kubiya platform, designed to empower users to deploy infrastructure effortlessly using Terraform modules. It provides a dynamic tool that ingests any Terraform module and allows users to self-serve resources with features like Just-In-Time (JIT) approvals, TTLs, and more.

With this kiosk, you can offload the complexity of Terraform knowledge and enable users to provision infrastructure safely and efficiently!

## ü§ñ How It Works

### 1. **User Request**

- **Users** interact with the bot using natural language.
- Example: "I need a new environment in eu-west-1!"

### 2. **Variable Processing**

- **Bot** parses the request and identifies which Terraform module matches best.
- **Variable Decoder** extracts required variables and applies defaults.

### 3. **Interactive Configuration**

- **Bot** engages with the user to fill in any missing information.
- Provides examples and default values to assist the user.

### 4. **Terraform Planning**

- **Bot** triggers the Terraform Engine to generate a plan.
- User can review the plan before applying changes.

### 5. **Approval Workflow**

- Depending on the configuration, the bot may:
  - Create a Pull Request in Git for code review.
  - Request Just-In-Time approval from an **Approver**.
  - Apply changes directly if allowed.

### 6. **Deployment**

- Upon approval, the **Terraform Engine** applies the changes.
- **Bot** notifies the user of success or any issues.

## üé≠ Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Developer Needs a New Database

**User**: "Hey, I need a new PostgreSQL database for testing."

**Bot**:

- Identifies the appropriate Terraform module.
- Asks for required variables (e.g., database name, size).
- Provides defaults and examples.
- Generates a Terraform plan and shares it with the user.
- Requests approval if necessary.
- Provisions the database upon approval.

### Scenario 2: Temporary Environment for QA

**User**: "Set up a temporary environment for QA testing."

**Bot**:

- Matches the request to a Terraform module that sets up environments.
- Collects necessary information interactively.
- Sets a TTL on the resources to ensure automatic teardown.
- Deploys the environment.
- Notifies the user and schedules resource cleanup.

---

## üîí Security and Compliance

- **Just-In-Time Approvals**: Ensure that all changes are authorized before deployment.
- **Time-To-Live (TTL)**: Automatically clean up resources after a set period to prevent sprawl.
- **Audit Trails**: All interactions and changes are logged for compliance and auditing purposes.
- **Access Control**: Define which users or groups can interact with the kiosk.

---

## üìà Benefits

- **Empowers Users**: Allow team members to provision infrastructure without deep Terraform knowledge.
- **Improves Efficiency**: Speeds up the provisioning process by automating variable resolution and deployment.
- **Enhances Compliance**: Keeps infrastructure changes within approved guidelines and processes.
- **Reduces Errors**: Interactive configuration and validation help prevent misconfigurations.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Integrations

- **Slack**: For interactive communication and notifications.
- **GitHub/GitLab**: For PR workflows and code reviews.
- **Terraform**: Core engine for infrastructure provisioning.
- **Approval Systems**: Integrate with existing approval processes or tools.
