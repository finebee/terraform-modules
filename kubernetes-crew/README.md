users                     = ["user@example.com"]
groups                    = ["platform-team"]

scheduled_tasks = {
  health_check = {
    enabled    = true
    start_time = "2024-01-01T09:00:00Z"
    repeat     = "daily"
  }
  capacity_check = {
    enabled    = true
    start_time = "2024-01-01T10:00:00Z"

## 🗣️ Your Crew in Action

### 1. Automated Health Checks
```plaintext
# The crew automatically reports every morning
Crew: 🏥 Daily Health Check Report
> Good morning! I've completed our morning inspection:
> 
> ✅ Fleet Status:
> - All 5 nodes standing strong
> - Control plane sailing smoothly
> - Resource seas are calm
> 
> ⚠️ Weather Warning:
> - Storm brewing in 'analytics' namespace (85% memory pressure)
> - Two pods have gone overboard in 'backend' waters
> 
> Shall I:
> 1. Launch a rescue mission for the failing pods
> 2. Navigate around the memory pressure
> 3. Chart a detailed course of action
```

### 2. Resource Optimization
```plaintext
# Weekly automated check
Crew: 📊 Weekly Resource Analysis
> I've analyzed your cluster's resource usage:
>
> 💡 Optimization Opportunities:
> 1. frontend-app is overprovisioned
>    - Current: 2CPU/4GB
>    - Recommended: 1CPU/2GB
>    - Potential savings: $120/month
>
> 2. Found 3 idle deployments
>    - test-env (unused for 30 days)
>    - staging-db (no traffic)
>    - old-cache (deprecated)
>
> Would you like me to:
> 1. Prepare resource adjustment PR
> 2. Clean up idle resources
> 3. Show detailed analysis
```

### 3. Interactive Troubleshooting
```plaintext
@Kubiya investigate high latency in payment service
> 🔍 Investigating payment service latency...
>
> Found several contributing factors:
> 1. Database connection pool near limit (90%)
> 2. High pod CPU throttling (75%)
> 3. Network policy limiting connections
>
> Recommended actions:
> 1. Increase connection pool size
> 2. Scale up CPU limits
> 3. Adjust network policy
>
> Should I help you implement these fixes?
```

### 4. Deployment Management
```plaintext
@Kubiya deploy new version of auth-service
> 🚀 Planning deployment for auth-service
>
> Pre-deployment checks:
> ✅ Target cluster healthy
> ✅ Sufficient resources available
> ✅ Backup exists
> ⚠️ High traffic period
>
> Recommended strategy:
> - Canary deployment (20% traffic)
> - 15-minute observation window
> - Automatic rollback on errors
>
> Shall we proceed with this approach?
```

### 5. Security Monitoring
```plaintext
# Daily automated security scan
Crew: 🔒 Security Scan Results
> Completed daily security assessment:
>
> 🛡️ Findings:
> - 3 pods running as root
> - Outdated base image in 'payment-processor'
> - Missing network policies in 'data' namespace
>
> Critical Updates Available:
> - ingress-nginx: 1.8.1 -> 1.9.0 (security fix)
> - cert-manager: 1.11.0 -> 1.12.0
>
> Would you like me to:
> 1. Generate security fix PRs
> 2. Apply critical updates
> 3. Show detailed report
```
