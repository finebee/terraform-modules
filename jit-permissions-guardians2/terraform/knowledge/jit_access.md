# JIT Access Management Guide

## Access Request Process

### Handling Access Request Failures
If your access request fails, please note:
1. Most failures occur due to lack of permissions
2. You need approval before accessing most tools
3. Use the access request workflow:
   ```
   @jit-guardian request access for [purpose]
   ```
4. Wait for approval before retrying operations
5. Do not attempt to use list/view tools without approval

### Common Issues & Solutions
1. Permission Denied
   - Always start with an access request
   - Ensure your request clearly states the purpose
   - Wait for approval confirmation

2. Failed Operations
   - Check if you have active approved access
   - Request new access if previous access expired
   - Include specific resource details in requests

3. Emergency Access
   - Use urgent flag for critical requests
   - Provide detailed justification
   - Contact approvers directly if needed

## Best Practices
1. Request minimum required permissions
2. Specify clear time-bound access needs
3. Include detailed purpose for audit trail
4. Request access well before needed
5. Release access when no longer needed
